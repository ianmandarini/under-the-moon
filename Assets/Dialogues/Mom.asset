  - My baby is crying way more than usual today.
  - It must be that  moon again.
  - In fact, my baby always cries during full moons.
  - But I made an oath to take care of my son.
  - Even though I found him abandoned in the sewers, I am his mother.
  - Shhhh... Shhhh... Stay calm son.
  - Everything will be fine.
  - Right?
